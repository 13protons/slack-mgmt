# slack-mgmt

A utility library for doing things to your slack account.

## Methods

As of v0.0.1 this utility will simply download every file in your slack org.

## Setup

Add your credentials to `example.env`, rename it to `.env`, and **REMEMBER TO ADD `.env` TO YOUR `.gitignore` FILE SO YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY PUBLISH YOUR CREDENTIALS TO GITHUB!**

To get those credentials, go [create and app](https://api.slack.com/apps) and [generate a user token](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens).
